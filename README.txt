INTRODUCTION

* This repo is for learning and testing type script which is described at https://www.typescriptlang.org/.
* I use VSCode.
* There's online docs, in particular, RTFM @ https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html.
* This repo contains the typescript engine and presumes node is installed (my path, ie, is /c/Program Files/nodejs).
* To look at the syntax, open up intro.ts, and decomment snippets beginning with '////' and then execute. In VSC
    it's compiled with 'npx tsc intro.ts' from the terminal.
* As my learning continues, additional source code will be added.

HISTORY

* strings with $ like '$ ...' indicate a bash command; you already have the $ so don't type it at the prompt
* used '$ npm init -y' to create package.json
* used '$ npm install typescript --save-dev' to install TS which autogenerated .package-lock.json and node_modules/
    * run '$ npx tsc in node_modules' to compile TS to JS
    * in order to create tsconfig.json for TS, '$ npx tsc -init'
* set '"main": "intro.js"' in package.json for VSCode to execute TS output with F5
* used git -init for initial commit
